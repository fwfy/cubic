# Cubic - A multi-purpose, multi-platform chatbot.
Cubic is the successor to the (closed-source) CakepopÂ² bot.

Cubic is designed to be highly extensible, with a modular design for both platform integration and functionality-providing plugins. All the platform-specific code is handled in its own dedicated module, and the "fun stuff" happens in the plugins.

Currently in development. Feel free to contribute!
